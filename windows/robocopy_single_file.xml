name: robocopy file (windows)
description: Robust File and Folder Copy for windows. This example copies a single file to a remote computer. shared-dest-dir should be shared with appropriate permissions. Since robocopy returns a non-zero exit code, rundll32 sets the overall errorlevel to zero. rundll32 without any arguments is effectively a no-op.
